# Electric-Vehicle-Population-in-the-State-of-Washington

The main objective of the analysis conducted on the electric car sales in the United States was to understand the trends in electric car sales in Washington and across the United States, identify the most popular electric car brands and models, and visualize sales data across states.

Two datasets were used for this analysis. The first dataset contained information on electric vehicles registered in Washington state, including county, state, model year, make, model, and electric range. The second dataset contained statistics on the number of electric vehicles registered by the Department of Licensing each month in various states around the United States, including date, state, and electric vehicle (EV) total.

The primary variables of the first dataset were county, state, model year, make, model, and electric range, while the primary variables of the second dataset were date, state, and EV total.
